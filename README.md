# DataTune Website

Welcome to the a repository for the DataTune website, the premier platform for the Nashville data conference. This website is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide a seamless experience for over 300 data professionals attending the conference.

## Overview

I was the sole volunteer to build DataTune's conference website that brings together more than 300 data professionals from around the Nashville area. The website serves as the central hub for all conference-related activities, including registration, event scheduling, and speaker signups.
